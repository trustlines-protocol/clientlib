## [0.13.7] - 2020-10-28

### Changed

  It returns a list of all delegation fees applied in transaction with given hash
  where the fee payer is the loaded user

  for which details are returned

- Add function `Payment.confirmPayment` to confirm any `PaymentTxObject` returned by `prepare`
  and potentially send a payment message along with the payment

## [0.13.0] - 2020-04-23

(requires relay version >=0.15.0)

### Changed

- Transaction prepare functions do not return `ethFees` and `delegationFees` anymore, instead they return `txFees` always,
  which represent the chain coin fees or delegation fees depending on which wallet type was used.
  The following fields exist: `totalFee`, `baseFee`, `gasLimit`, `gasPrice`, `feeRecipient`(`null`, if not set),
  `currencyNetworkOfFees`(`null`, if not set). (BREAKING)
- Transaction fees will now have `null` `currencyNetworkOfFees` when delegation fees are zero instead of `zeroAddress` (BREAKING)
- Meta transactions will now use `feeRecipient` given by the relay provider (BREAKING)
- Use `user` and `counterparty` instead of `address` for TrustlineObject and TrustlineRaw types.
  The previous `address` now corresponds to `counterparty` (BREAKING)
- Use gas limits from contracts tests for transactions and meta transactions
- Change link schema and api (`X.createLink`) to allow for easier addition of optional data (BREAKING)

### Added

- Added function to get trustline balance updates `Trustline.getTrustlineBalanceUpdates` (Requires relay server >=v0.15.0)
- Added function to get transfer details `Payment.getTransferDetails` either from tx hash or event identifier: (blockHash, logIndex)
  (Requires relay server >=v0.15.0)
- Events now include `blockHash` and `logIndex` (Requires relay server >=v0.15.0)
- Added function to decline payment requests `Messaging.paymentRequestDecline`
- Added function to check for tx status via tx hash or meta-tx status either via enveloping tx-hash or raw-tx `Transaction.getTxStatus`

### Deprecated

- `transactionId` on events is deprecated for `transactionHash`. (Based on relay server deprecations)

## [0.12.1] - 2020-02-20

### Changed
